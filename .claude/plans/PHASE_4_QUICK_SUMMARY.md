## How to Test

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/kike/Repos/OpenDeck
docker-compose up
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/kike/Repos/OpenDeck/opendeck-portal
npm start
```

### 3. Test Registration
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:4200/auth/register`
- Create account with any email/username/password
- Should auto-login and redirect to dashboard

### 4. Test Login
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:4200/auth/login`
- Use credentials: `test@example.com` / `password123`
- Should redirect to dashboard
- User info should appear in topbar

### 5. Test Protected Routes
- Logout first
- Try to access: `http://localhost:4200/pages/flashcards`
- Should redirect to login
- After login, should return to flashcards page

### 6. Test Logout
- Click user icon in topbar
- Click logout button
- Confirm in dialog
- Should redirect to login page

## Build Status

```bash
npm run build
# Result: SUCCESS ✓
# No TypeScript compilation errors
```

---

## What's Different from Before

### Before Phase 4:
- Login used template-driven forms with no backend integration
- No register component
- No route protection
- No user info in topbar
- Simulated auth with setTimeout

### After Phase 4:
- Login uses reactive forms with full backend integration
- Register component with comprehensive validation
- Routes protected with authGuard and guestGuard
- User info and avatar in topbar
- Real HTTP calls to backend API
- JWT token management
- Return URL support

---

## Next Phase Recommendations

### Phase 5: Document Management
- Upload documents component
- Folder/class organization UI
- Document list with metadata
- File type icons and previews

### Phase 6: Flashcard Generation
- Document selection for processing
- AI extraction progress indicator
- Generated flashcard review interface
- Edit/approve flashcards workflow

### Phase 7: Study Features
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Study session tracking
- Progress analytics
- Flashcard favorites/bookmarks

## Important Notes

1. **Development Mode**: Backend currently bypasses authentication. Full auth validation will work once backend is updated.

2. **JWT Storage**: Tokens stored in localStorage. Consider httpOnly cookies for production.

3. **Test Credentials**: Use `test@example.com` / `password123` for testing.

4. **Guards**: Both authGuard and guestGuard are functional and protect routes correctly.

5. **Error Handling**: All components handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages.

## Quick Verification Checklist

- [x] Login component loads at `/auth/login`
- [x] Register component loads at `/auth/register`
- [x] Forms validate inputs correctly
- [x] Login calls AuthService with email/password
- [x] Register calls AuthService with email/username/password
- [x] JWT token stored in localStorage after success
- [x] User info stored in localStorage after success
- [x] TopBar displays user information when logged in
- [x] Logout clears auth data and redirects
- [x] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated
- [x] Auth pages redirect to dashboard when authenticated
- [x] Return URL preserved during login redirect
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] Dark mode works on all auth pages

## API Integration

All auth components integrate with backend:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/login
POST /api/v1/auth/register
```

Auth interceptor automatically adds JWT to all requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
