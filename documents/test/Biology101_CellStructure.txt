Difficulty: Beginner to Intermediate

===== Chapter 1: Introduction to Cells =====

Section 1.1: What is a Cell?

A cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Cells are often called the "building blocks of life." The cell theory, one of the fundamental principles of biology, states that:
1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells

Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 when he observed cork under a microscope.

Section 1.2: Types of Cells

There are two main types of cells:

Prokaryotic Cells:
- Lack a true nucleus
- DNA is located in a region called the nucleoid
- No membrane-bound organelles
- Generally smaller (1-10 micrometers)
- Examples: Bacteria and Archaea

Eukaryotic Cells:
- Have a true nucleus enclosed by a nuclear membrane
- Contain membrane-bound organelles
- Generally larger (10-100 micrometers)
- Examples: Animals, plants, fungi, and protists

===== Chapter 2: Cell Membrane =====

Section 2.1: Structure of the Cell Membrane

The cell membrane (also called the plasma membrane) is a selectively permeable barrier that separates the interior of the cell from the external environment. It is composed of:

1. Phospholipid Bilayer:
   - Made of phospholipids arranged in two layers
   - Hydrophilic (water-loving) heads face outward
   - Hydrophobic (water-fearing) tails face inward
   - Creates a barrier to most water-soluble substances

2. Proteins:
   - Integral proteins: Span the entire membrane
   - Peripheral proteins: Attached to the surface
   - Functions: Transport, receptors, enzymes, cell recognition

3. Cholesterol:
   - Found in animal cell membranes
   - Maintains membrane fluidity
   - Provides stability

The fluid mosaic model describes the cell membrane as a flexible structure where proteins float in or on the phospholipid bilayer like icebergs in the ocean.

Section 2.2: Functions of the Cell Membrane

The cell membrane performs several critical functions:
- Protection: Provides a barrier to protect cellular contents
- Transport: Controls what enters and exits the cell
- Cell Recognition: Contains markers for cell identification
- Communication: Receives signals from other cells
- Attachment: Anchors cells to other cells and the extracellular matrix

===== Chapter 3: Nucleus =====

Section 3.1: Nuclear Structure

The nucleus is the control center of the eukaryotic cell. It is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which contains nuclear pores that regulate the movement of molecules in and out of the nucleus.

Key components of the nucleus:

1. Nuclear Envelope:
   - Double membrane structure
   - Contains nuclear pores (about 3000-4000 per nucleus)
   - Continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum

2. Nucleoplasm:
   - Gel-like substance inside the nucleus
   - Contains chromatin and the nucleolus

3. Chromatin:
   - Complex of DNA and proteins (histones)
   - Condenses to form chromosomes during cell division
   - Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)

4. Nucleolus:
   - Dense region within the nucleus
   - Site of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis
   - Assembles ribosome subunits

Section 3.2: Functions of the Nucleus

- Stores genetic information (DNA)
- Controls cellular activities by regulating gene expression
- Site of DNA replication
- Site of transcription (DNA to RNA)

===== Chapter 4: Mitochondria =====

Section 4.1: The Powerhouse of the Cell

Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. They are often referred to as the "powerhouses of the cell" because they generate most of the cell's supply of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is used as a source of chemical energy.

Structure of Mitochondria:
- Outer membrane: Smooth and permeable to small molecules
- Inner membrane: Highly folded into cristae, site of electron transport chain
- Matrix: Contains enzymes for the citric acid cycle
- Intermembrane space: Space between the two membranes

Section 4.2: Cellular Respiration

Mitochondria carry out cellular respiration, a process that converts glucose and oxygen into ATP, carbon dioxide, and water. The process occurs in three main stages:

1. Glycolysis (occurs in cytoplasm):
   - Breaks down glucose into pyruvate
   - Produces 2 ATP molecules
   - Does not require oxygen

2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):
   - Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix
   - Produces electron carriers (NADH and FADH2)
   - Releases CO2 as a waste product

3. Electron Transport Chain:
   - Occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane
   - Uses electron carriers to produce most ATP
   - Requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor
   - Produces approximately 34 ATP molecules

Total ATP yield from one glucose molecule: approximately 36-38 ATP

===== Chapter 5: Endoplasmic Reticulum =====

Section 5.1: Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)

The rough endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranous tubules and flattened sacs covered with ribosomes on the outer surface. The ribosomes give it a "rough" appearance.

Functions of Rough ER:
- Protein synthesis: Ribosomes on RER synthesize proteins
- Protein folding: Helps fold proteins into proper 3D structure
- Protein modification: Adds sugar groups (glycosylation)
- Quality control: Ensures proteins are properly formed
- Packaging: Prepares proteins for transport to Golgi apparatus

Section 5.2: Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes on its surface and appears smooth under a microscope.

Functions of Smooth ER:
- Lipid synthesis: Manufactures phospholipids and cholesterol
- Carbohydrate metabolism: Stores and releases glucose
- Detoxification: Breaks down drugs and toxins (especially in liver cells)
- Calcium storage: Stores calcium ions for cellular signaling

===== Chapter 6: Golgi Apparatus =====

Section 6.1: Structure and Function

The Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi complex or Golgi body) consists of a series of flattened, membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. It is the cell's "post office," receiving, modifying, and shipping proteins and lipids.

Structure:
- Cis face: Receiving side (near ER)
- Medial region: Processing area
- Trans face: Shipping side (facing cell membrane)

Functions:
1. Modification: Further modifies proteins from the ER
   - Adds or removes sugar groups
   - Cuts proteins into smaller pieces
   - Adds phosphate groups

2. Sorting: Directs proteins to their correct destinations
   - Lysosomes
   - Cell membrane
   - Secretion outside the cell

3. Packaging: Packages materials into vesicles for transport

===== Chapter 7: Lysosomes and Peroxisomes =====

Section 7.1: Lysosomes - The Recycling Centers

Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that contain digestive enzymes (hydrolytic enzymes). They function as the cell's waste disposal system.

Functions of Lysosomes:
- Break down cellular waste and debris
- Digest bacteria and viruses
- Recycle worn-out organelles (autophagy)
- Break down food particles in single-celled organisms
- Programmed cell death (apoptosis)

The pH inside lysosomes is acidic (around pH 5), which is optimal for the digestive enzymes.

Section 7.2: Peroxisomes - Detoxification Centers

Peroxisomes are small organelles that contain enzymes for various metabolic reactions.

Functions of Peroxisomes:
- Break down fatty acids through beta-oxidation
- Detoxify harmful substances (like alcohol)
- Produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a byproduct
- Convert hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen using catalase

===== Chapter 8: Cytoskeleton =====

Section 8.1: The Cellular Framework

The cytoskeleton is a network of protein filaments that extends throughout the cytoplasm. It provides structural support and facilitates cell movement.

Three Types of Cytoskeletal Filaments:

1. Microfilaments (Actin Filaments):
   - Diameter: 7 nm (smallest)
   - Composition: Actin protein
   - Functions: Cell movement, muscle contraction, cell division

2. Intermediate Filaments:
   - Diameter: 8-10 nm (medium)
   - Composition: Various proteins (keratin, lamin, etc.)
   - Functions: Structural support, nuclear envelope maintenance

3. Microtubules:
   - Diameter: 25 nm (largest)
   - Composition: Tubulin protein
   - Functions: Cell shape, chromosome movement, organelle transport

Section 8.2: Motor Proteins

Motor proteins move along cytoskeletal filaments to transport cargo:
- Kinesins: Move toward the cell periphery (plus end of microtubules)
- Dyneins: Move toward the cell center (minus end of microtubules)
- Myosins: Move along actin filaments
